# Visual-Sort

This project is a simple web-based application built using **React** that helps visualize different sorting algorithms, such as **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Bubble Sort**. The user can select any of the algorithms to see the sorting process step-by-step with a 2-second delay for each comparison. The application also features a colorful and dynamic UI where each number has a different height and color for easy visualization.

## Features

- **Visualize Sorting Algorithms**: Watch how Selection, Insertion, and Bubble Sort algorithms work step-by-step.
- **Dynamic UI**: Each number has a different color and height, making the sorting process engaging and easy to follow.
- **Reset Functionality**: Reset the numbers to their original order to try sorting again with different algorithms.
- **Interactive**: Buttons to trigger each sorting algorithm and a reset option to reload the original array.
  
## How It Works

- **Selection Sort**: Repeatedly selects the smallest element and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
- **Insertion Sort**: Iteratively builds a sorted portion by inserting elements into their correct positions.
- **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualizer.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd sorting-visualizer
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing sorting algorithms.
- **CSS**: For styling and animations.

## Future Improvements

- Add more sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
- Provide real-time analysis of time complexity and comparison counts.
- Add speed control to adjust the sorting speed dynamically.

Feel free to customize this further depending on your project and preferences!
